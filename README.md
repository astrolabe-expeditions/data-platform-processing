## What is Astrolabe Expeditions?

[Astrolabe Expeditions](https://www.astrolabe-expeditions.org/) is an non-profit association that develops participatory science programmes with
laboratories to enable citizens to actively contribute to scientific research.

Citizens' expeditions are set up to collect large-scale scientific data and involve citizens in understanding and preserving the ocean.

## Local development

Clone the repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:astrolabe-expeditions/data-platform-processing.git
```

Switch to the repo folder
```sh
cd data-platform-processing
```

Create new virtual env with Virtualenv
```sh
virtualenv venv
